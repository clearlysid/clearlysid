### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Nice to meet you! I'm an designer who loves writing code and I currently intern at [Headout](https://www.headout.com). I'm mostly working on front-end technologies, creating interfaces and I adore silky smooth animations.

Here's some of my favorite open-source projects:

1. [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)
2. [Anime.js](https://github.com/juliangarnier/anime)
3. [Swup.js](https://github.com/swup/swup)
4. [Calibre](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/calibre)
