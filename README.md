# ðŸ‘‹ hi, welcome to the @clearlysid github

This special breed of interaction designer is often found writing code on occasion.

Sometimes it works, but most times it doesn't... ...until he figures it out after hours of painful debugging.

This particular dude is currently usually found building things at [Headout](https://www.headout.com).
